# Conventional Commit Messages 

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

## Example

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

- API or UI relevant changes
    - `feat` Commits, that add or remove a new feature to the API or UI
    - `fix` Commits, that fix a API or UI bug of a preceded `feat` commit
- `refactor` Commits, that rewrite/restructure your code, however do not change any API or UI behaviour
    - `perf` Commits are special `refactor` commits, that improve performance
- `style` Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `test` Commits, that add missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `docs` Commits, that affect documentation only
- `build` Commits, that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version, ...
- `ops` Commits, that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery, ...
- `chore` Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore`
